- Agentic AI that automatically detects and remediates:
    - Schema drift (avg resolution time today: 3–6 hours)
    - Failed jobs (avg MTTR today: 2–4 hours)
    - Latency anomalies (avg investigation time today: 4–8 hours)
- Supervised mode for human-in-the-loop governance
- Full observability layer for transparency into decisions, causes, and success rates
- Real-time dashboards with MTTR, uptime, and issue frequency KPIs
- Plug-and-play SDK to integrate with existing ingestion/orchestration platforms

# Time & Effort Saved:

- Reduce schema drift MTTR from 4 hours to <30 minutes
- Failed job resolution improved by 70% via auto-retries/config tuning
- Latency anomaly handling drops from hours to minutes
- Estimated 50–60% reduction in engineering hours spent on break-fix ops
